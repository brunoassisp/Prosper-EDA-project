# Prosper-EDA-project
**Prosper** allows people to invest in each other in a way that is financially and socially rewarding. On *Prosper*, borrowers list loan requests between $2,000 and $35,000 and individual investors invest as little as $25 in each loan listing they select. Prosper handles the servicing of the loan on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors.

This project was developed during the **Data Analyst Nanodegree** course from [**Udacity**](http://udacity.com/) and it used [**Loan Data from Prosper**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1516484404837000&usg=AFQjCNF4ZxodkFyMFqZIWkrXYpjYnzAlFQ).

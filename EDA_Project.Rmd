# Loan Data from Prosper
**_by Bruno de Assis Pereira_**

---

In this project, I am going to present an **Exploratory Data Analysis** over a 
dataset that contains informations about **Loans**. This dataset belongs to [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/) and it contains **_113,937 loans_** with 
**_81 variables_** on each loan.

The **Loan Data from Prosper** presents a lot of informations about the profile 
of a borrower that can be found by analysing the *Listings*. By analysing this 
dataset, I intend to provide useful information that enables a investor to 
safely select the best loan option to apply.

A data dictionary was provided to aid through the whole process, this can be 
found in the **appendix** by the end of this document.

Let's begin!

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, packages}
# Loading all of the packages that are going to be used during the analysis

library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(GGally)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
```

## Understanding the data
```{r echo=FALSE, load_the_data}
# Load the Data
setwd('C:/Users/Bruno/Documents/Udacity/R/Project')

loanData <- read.csv('../prosperLoanData.csv')
str(loanData)
```

Since we have more than 80 variables, for this first moment, I want to select 
variables that can be related somehow and reduce the number of analysed 
variables.

To aid me over this selection process, I am making use of the *ggpairs* 
function.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=14, correlation_matrix}
# Reordering factor variables
LoanStatus_ord_lvl <- c(levels(loanData$LoanStatus)[1:6]
      ,levels(loanData$LoanStatus)[8:12]
      ,'Past Due (>120 days)')
loanData$LoanStatus <- ordered(loanData$LoanStatus, levels = LoanStatus_ord_lvl)

ProsperRating_ord_lvl <- c('', 'AA', 'A', levels(loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha.)[4:8])
loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha. <- ordered(loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha., levels = ProsperRating_ord_lvl)

# Enabling reproducible results.
set.seed(2)

# Defining a list of columns to be analysed
columns_list <- c('LoanStatus'
                  ,'LoanOriginalAmount'
                  ,'BorrowerRate'
                  ,'EstimatedReturn'
                  ,'ProsperRating..Alpha.'
                  ,'ProsperScore'
                  ,'CurrentDelinquencies'
                  ,'StatedMonthlyIncome'
                  ,'Recommendations'
                  ,'InvestmentFromFriendsCount')

# Sampling the original dataset so it can be used in a correlation matrix
loanData_samp <- loanData[sample(1:nrow(loanData), 10000), columns_list]

# Plotting the matrix
ggpairs(loanData_samp
        ,axisLabels = 'internal')
```

This plot brings a nice overview over the relationships among the selected 
variables. By providing scatterplots, histograms, box plots and correlation 
coeficients, this matrix starts to give some sense over the data behavior. 
For instance, if we take the variables **_BorrowerRate_** and  
**_EstimatedReturn_**, we can see that they are positively 
correlated by looking to the _coeficient_ and to the _scatterplot_.

With that in mind, let's take a closer look over each of these variables.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, subsetting_data}
#
# ...Removing loan registries that originated before July 2009...
# ...This can be done by subsetting our dataset...
# ...The 'columns_list' defined earlier will be used from now on...
#

ld <- subset(loanData
       ,as.Date(LoanOriginationDate) >= as.Date('2009-07-01')
       ,select = columns_list
       )

ld$ProsperScore <- factor(ld$ProsperScore)

str(ld)
```

## Univariate Plots Section

#### Analysing how the **Loan Status** variable is distributed
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, loan_status}
ggplot(data = ld
       ,aes(x = LoanStatus)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#099DD9')
                 ,stat='count') +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1),
        axis.title.x=element_blank())

table(ld$LoanStatus)
```

---

By taking a look at the plot and the table above, we can easily see that 
the **Current** status is the highest one. Also, we can realize that there is
not many loans with delay on payments. However, the number of **Chargeoffs** is
the third highest, which means that more than 5,000 borrowers became delinquent 
and did not pay their debts in due time.

Another interesting thing to keep in mind is that in the analysed period there
are no loans that have been **Canceled**.

Let's keep going.

---

#### Analysing how the Loan Amount variable is distributed
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, loan_amount}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = ld
       ,aes(x = LoanOriginalAmount)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,binwidth = 1000) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,35000,2500))

plot2 <- ggplot(data = ld
       ,aes(x = LoanOriginalAmount)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,binwidth = .05) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("LoanOriginalAmount (log10 scale)")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow=2)

summary(ld$LoanOriginalAmount)
```

---

The Loan values range from $1,000 to $35,000 and we have some common values
in this interval, something around $4,000, $10,000 and $15,000.

---

#### Analysing how the Listings are distributed across the **Risk Ratings**
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, listings}
ggplot(data = ld
       ,aes(x = ProsperRating..Alpha.)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#099DD9')
                 ,stat='count') +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank())

table(ld$ProsperRating..Alpha.)
```

---

The **Risk Ratings** defined by **Prosper** represent an estimated average
annualized loss rate range. With **AA** being the lowest risk and **HR** the 
highest risk associated.

In this histogram we can see a **Normal Distribution** where the upper and lower
bounds present a small frequency, and we have higher frequencies in the middle.

Besides that, we see that we have **131** registries without a defined Rating
(i.e. blank).

---

#### Analysing how the **Estimated Return** is distributed
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ld
       ,aes(x = EstimatedReturn)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,bins=150) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-.2,.30,.04), labels = seq(-.2,.30,.04)*100) +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt') +
  xlab("Estimated Return (%)")

summary(ld$EstimatedReturn)
```

---

The **Estimated Return** is Bimodal, and it ranges from -18.3%
to 28.4%.

This scenario is probably related to the risk associated.

If we look to the **Estimated Return** distribution according to the 
**Risk** associated, what we will find?

---

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, yield_by_risk}
lower_levels <- levels(ld$ProsperRating..Alpha.)[0:5]

lower_risk <- ggplot(data = subset(ld, ProsperRating..Alpha. %in% lower_levels),
       aes(x = EstimatedReturn)) +
  ggtitle('Lower Risk Investments (AA - C)') +
  xlab("Estimated Return (%)") +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,bins=20) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-.2,.30,.04), labels = seq(-.2,.30,.04)*100) +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt')

higher_levels <- levels(ld$ProsperRating..Alpha.)[6:8]

higher_risk <- ggplot(data = subset(ld, ProsperRating..Alpha. %in% higher_levels),
       aes(x = EstimatedReturn)) +
  ggtitle('Higher Risk Investments (D - HR)') +
  xlab("Estimated Return (%)") +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,bins=20) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-.2,.30,.04), labels = seq(-.2,.30,.04)*100) +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt')

grid.arrange(lower_risk, higher_risk, nrow=2)
```

---

As we can see, in lower levels, a **Estimated Return** between 4% and 12% are 
more usual, and we have a Normal Distribution of the data.

On the other hand, for higher levels, a **Estimated Return** between 8% and 
18% occurs more frequently, and here we can see a Left Skewed Distribution.

However, the **Higher Risk** investments presents **negative** returns, whereas
the **Lower Risk** almost do not present this kind of situation.

Later on, we can explore this Estimated Return behaviour a bit deeper.

---

#### Borrower rate distribution
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ld
       ,aes(x = BorrowerRate)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,bins=100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(.0,.37,.02), labels = seq(.0,.37,.02)*100) +
  xlab("Borrower Rate (%)")

summary(ld$BorrowerRate)
```

---

The Borrower's Rate range from 4% to 36% with a mean of 19.6%.

The rate of something close to 32% is the most common one. It is interesting
since it is a pretty high interest rate. 

One thing that comes to my mind is how is this related to the risk? Does do
people who offer higher rates usually presents a higher risk?

---

#### Analysing how the **Prosper Score** is distributed
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, }
ggplot(data = ld,
       aes(x = ProsperScore)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#099DD9')
                 ,bins = 11
                 ,stat='count') +
  xlab('')

table(ld$ProsperScore)
```

---

The **Prosper Score** assess borrower's profile to provide another tool to the
investors when selecting a listing.

In this case, **1** represents the worst score and consequently has a higher
risk associated to it, and **11** represents the best score.

---

#### Monthly Income of Borrowers
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,}
income <- ggplot(data=ld,
       aes(x=StatedMonthlyIncome)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,bins = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1750010, 175000)) +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt') +
  xlab("Monthly Income")

income_log10 <- ggplot(data=ld,
       aes(x=StatedMonthlyIncome)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,bins = 100) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans=log10_trans(),
                     breaks=trans_breaks('log10', function(x) 10 ^ x),
                     labels=trans_format("log10", math_format(10^.x))) +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt') +
  xlab("Monthly Income (log10)")

grid.arrange(income, income_log10, nrow=2)

summary(ld$StatedMonthlyIncome)

quantile(ld$StatedMonthlyIncome,0.95)
```

---

With the information above, we can see that most of the incomes (**95% of them**)
are below **$12,500**.

The interesting thing to notice here is that the values are between **$0 and 
$1,750,003**. 

So we definetly have some outliers in our dataset.

---

#### Current Delinquencies

Instead of caring about how many delinquencies a borrower had, I will create a
variable that tells us whether a borrower has been delinquent.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,}
ld$HasBeenDelinquent <- ifelse(ld$CurrentDelinquencies > 0, 1, 0)
```

---

#### Recommendations & Investment From Friends Count
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3,}
recom <- ggplot(data=ld,
       aes(x=Recommendations)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt')

'« Recommendations Table »'
table(ld$Recommendations)
quantile(ld$Recommendations, .98)

invest <- ggplot(data=ld,
       aes(x=InvestmentFromFriendsCount)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt')

'« Investment From Friends Count Table »'
table(ld$InvestmentFromFriendsCount)
quantile(ld$InvestmentFromFriendsCount, .99)

grid.arrange(recom, invest, ncol=2)
```

---

If we take a look at these two variables, we can see that the number of
borrowers that have some occurence associated is too low.

For **Recommendations**, 98% of the data are composed by 0's, and
for **InvestmentFromFriendsCount**, 99% of the data are composed by 0's.

For this reason, these two variables won't be considered from now on.

---

## Bivariate Plots Section

Now that we have some views over the selected variables we can try to understand
how these data is related to each other.

#### Loan Amount x Risk
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.height=10}
overplot <- ggplot(data=ld,
       aes(x=ProsperRating..Alpha., y=LoanOriginalAmount)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Loan Amount")

better_plot <- ggplot(data=ld,
       aes(x=ProsperRating..Alpha., y=LoanOriginalAmount, group=1)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/100) +
  geom_line(stat='summary', fun.y=mean, linetype = 1
            ,aes(colour='Mean'), size=1) +
  geom_line(stat='summary', fun.y=median, linetype = 2
            ,aes(colour='Median'), size=1) +
  scale_color_manual(name='',values=c('#0000ff','#099dd9')) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Loan Amount") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

grid.arrange(overplot, better_plot, nrow=2)

ld.loan_by_risk <- ld %>%
  group_by(ProsperRating..Alpha.) %>%
  summarise(mean_loan_amount = mean(LoanOriginalAmount)
            ,median_loan_amount = median(LoanOriginalAmount)
            ,n=n())

colnames(ld.loan_by_risk)[1] <- 'Risk Rating'
colnames(ld.loan_by_risk)[2] <- 'Mean Loan Amount'
colnames(ld.loan_by_risk)[3] <- 'Median Loan Amount'

knitr::kable(ld.loan_by_risk)
```

---

For our first bivariate plot we have the **Loan Amount** and the **Risk Rating**
variables.

The first plot could give us a sensation that most of the high loans were 
related to lower risk ratings, but if we try to see how these points were 
concentrated we will see that things change a little bit.

Taking the second plot as base, we can see that the diffence of loan amount
among the ratings exists and it grows as the risk raises. However, this is not
as significant as it seemed in the first plot.

Let's make this visualization even better.

---

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,}
ggplot(data=ld,
       aes(x=ProsperRating..Alpha., y=LoanOriginalAmount)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#e3f6fe', color="#044b69") +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('Loan Amount')
```

---

Now it is easier to understand how the **Loans Amount** vary among the 
**Risk Ratings**.

As the risk gets higher the loan amount decreases.

---

#### Borrower Rate x Risk Rating
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,}
main_plt <- ggplot(data=ld
       ,aes(x=EstimatedReturn, y=BorrowerRate)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/100, color='darkblue') +
  xlab('')

sec_plt <- ggplot(data=ld
       ,aes(x=EstimatedReturn, y=BorrowerRate)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/100) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,.2,.05), limits=c(0,.2)) +
  facet_wrap(~HasBeenDelinquent)

grid.arrange(main_plt, sec_plt, nrow=2)

cor.test(ld$EstimatedReturn, ld$BorrowerRate)
```

---

Here we can see that these two variables are **positively correlated**.

I tried to verify if the *Delinquents* could influence some how in the data, but
the results showed me that Delinquents (1) and Non-delinquents (0) are
distributed in the same way.

---

#### Monthly Income x Prosper Score
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,}
ggplot(data=ld
       ,aes(x=ProsperScore, y=StatedMonthlyIncome)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#e3f6fe', color="#044b69") +
  ylim(0, quantile(ld$StatedMonthlyIncome, .99)) +
  ylab('Monthly Income')
```

---

It is possible to notice that as the **Prosper Score** raises the **Income**
tends to grow as well.

Therefore, perhaps borrowers with a higher monthly income tend to be more
reliable and it makes some sense since those people has a higher chance of 
being able paying their debts.

---

#### Estimated Return x Risk Rating - For Chargedoffs
```{r}
ggplot(data=subset(ld, LoanStatus == 'Chargedoff')
       ,aes(x=ProsperRating..Alpha., y=EstimatedReturn)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/5
    ,position = position_jitter(h=0.1, w=0.3)) +
  xlab('')

with(subset(ld, LoanStatus == 'Chargedoff'), table(ProsperRating..Alpha.))
```

---

The loans that has a *Chargedoff* status are highly concentrated for higher
risk investments.

Since I added some noise to the data to analyse how the points were 
concentrated, the Estimated Return rate loses its meaning.

So let's create a box plot to see the correct behaviour of the Estimated Return
when related to Risk Ratings, and this time considering all possible status.

---

```{r}
ggplot(data=ld
       ,aes(x=ProsperRating..Alpha., y=EstimatedReturn)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#e3f6fe', color="#044b69") +
  xlab('')
```

---

This view is very interesting since it provide us a nice overview over the Risk 
levels when it comes to the estimated yield.

The levels from AA to C has a median return range of 5% to 10%, while the levels
D to HR, something between 12% to 14%.

Besides that, for this data history, **D and E** appear to present better 
results when compared to the other levels. The IQR (Interquartile Range) of
these two levels are more spread than the others and go from 10% to 15%.

## Multivariate Plots Section

We can go deeper in the analysis and give more sense to our data if we look how
other variables behave by adding then to one of the bivariate plots created
in the last section.

Let's try it out.

#### Monthly Income x Estimated Return colored by Risk Rating
```{r}
ggplot(data=ld
       ,aes(x=EstimatedReturn, y=(StatedMonthlyIncome+1)
            ,color=ProsperRating..Alpha.)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(10, quantile(ld$StatedMonthlyIncome, .99))
                     ,trans=log10_trans()) +
  ylab('Monthly Income')
```

---

In this first plot, I intended to verify if there was a relationship between 
**Monthly Income** and **Estimated Return**, but there is not.

Also, there is not a clear relationship between **Monthly Income** and 
**Risk Rating**.

---

#### Estimated Return x Borrower Rate colored by Risk Rating
```{r}
ggplot(data=subset(ld, ProsperRating..Alpha. != '')
       ,aes(x=BorrowerRate, y=EstimatedReturn, color=ProsperRating..Alpha.)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/50, size=2) +
  facet_wrap(~ProsperRating..Alpha.) +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

---

This plot presents a more interesting view over our dataset.

Here we can see that as the interest rate of the borrower raises, the Estimated
Return and the Risk Rating also raises.

---

#### Loan Amount x Estimated Return colored by Risk Rating
```{r}
ggplot(data=subset(ld, ProsperRating..Alpha. != ''),
       aes(x=EstimatedReturn, y=LoanOriginalAmount
           ,color=ProsperRating..Alpha.)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/100) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ProsperRating..Alpha.) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  ylab('Loan Amount')
```

---

The **Loan Amount** does not have any impact over the behaviour of the other
two variables.

---

#### Estimated Return x ProsperScore colored by Risk Rating
```{r}
ggplot(data=subset(ld, ProsperRating..Alpha. != '')
       ,aes(x=ProsperScore, y=EstimatedReturn, color=ProsperRating..Alpha.)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/50) +
  facet_wrap(~ProsperRating..Alpha.) +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

---

This plot provided interesting information since it showed a comparison between 
the two Prosper's evaluators.

At first, I thought they were going to present a similar behaviour to the 
**Estimated Return** values. That is as the return raise, **Prosper Score**
and **Risk Rating** would have a proportional increase in its risk.

---

```{r}
ggplot(data=ld
       ,aes(x=ProsperScore, y=EstimatedReturn)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#e3f6fe', color="#044b69")
```

---

As higher the risk is (closer to 1), the higher the **Estimated Return** gets.

---

## Final Plots and Summary

### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}
ggplot(data = ld
       ,aes(x = EstimatedReturn)) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black')
                 ,fill = I('#ffc04d')
                 ,bins=150) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-.2,.30,.04), labels = seq(-.2,.30,.04)*100) +
  coord_trans(y='sqrt') +
  xlab("Estimated Return (%)")

summary(ld$EstimatedReturn)
```

### Description One
This first plots provides a view over the distribution of the 
**Estimated Return** variable, as mentioned before it has **two peaks** and 
their are related to the risk associated.

Besides that, we can also see that some listings have a **negative returns**.

We can also easily notice where the most common values lay.
